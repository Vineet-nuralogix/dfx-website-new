extract facial blood flow information via a conventional video camera and convert the results into physiological and psychological information through machine learning.</p><p>Transdermal Optical Imaging™ is a new facial scanning technology that utilizes a conventional optical camera and advanced image processing to facilitate the imaging of facial-blood-flow (FBF) data from a human subject.</p><p>This imaging process transforms an incoming (live or recorded) digital video stream into extracted FBF data from designated areas of the face (called ROIs).</p><p>The facial-blood-flow (FBF) data that results from the TOI scan technology generates a unique source of data that NuraLogix is harnessing to provide valuable insights and discoveries into human physiology.</p><h3

relies on the face-tracker (FT) component to locate and dynamically track the subject’s facial landmarks and head contour. Note that the face-tracker is NOT used to recognize or otherwise identify the subject.</p><p>The face-tracker data is used anonymously to provide additional value to the TOI extraction process. For example the face position (3D coordinates) and simple facial expressions may also be provided to our user.</p><p>We have also implemented powerful machine-trained models which accurately predict demographics information such as AGE / GENDER / HEIGHT / WEIGHT</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-does-fbf-mean">What does FBF mean?<a href="#what-does-fbf-mean" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What does FBF mean?" title="Direct link to What does FBF mean?">​</a></h3><p>The term ‘FBF’ is a generalized 3-letter acronym (short form) meaning Facial Blood Flow and may be used interchangeably.
